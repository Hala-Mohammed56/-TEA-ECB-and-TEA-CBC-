# Project Title

"TEA-ECB" and "TEA-CBC‚Äù

## About The Project

The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA), a symmetric key block cipher known for its effectiveness and simplicity, is the main focus of this project. For settings with constrained computational resources, TEA is a great option due to its simple architecture and low resource needs.

## Built With

- PyCharm: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for writing and managing Python code.
- Python: The programming language used for implementing the TEA encryption algorithm and the program logic.
- Windows: The operating system on which the development environment and the program were executed.

## Getting Started

To run a local copy of the project for testing and development purposes, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your computer before you begin:
- Python: Verify that your machine has Python installed.

### Installing

1. Download the project files.
2. Extract the files to a location of your choice.

### Running the Program

1. Execute the main Python script by clicking on the run icon in PyCharm or by entering the following command in the terminal:
   python main.py
2. Follow the on-screen directions to input the required parameters, including the key, IV, and image path.
3. Wait for the encryption and decryption process to complete.
